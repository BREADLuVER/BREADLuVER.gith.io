        </p>
        <p>
           This killbox effectively takes advantage of the remarkable property of the wood fire generator (also windmill) that not a lot of people know about. The wood fire generator acts as a visual barrier for pawns, similar to a wall, but with the unique ability to allow passage. This distinctive characteristic enables the generator to be utilized as a sideways wall. When an enemy pawn passes through a generator, it temporarily loses sight and the ability to aim. As a result, strategically placing animals or heavily armored melee pawns around or on top of the generator creates a situation where enemies can be melee attacked for free before they regain their vision and will be forced into melee combat afterwards. Additionally, due to the generator's inherent high wealth, enemy pawns often engage in melee combat with the generator itself rather than focusing on the player pawns beating the * out of them.

        </div>
        <p>
          A creator on Bilibili harnessed this property and developed what is known as the sap killbox. To ensure its proper functioning, the sap killbox needs to be linked to the most valuable room in your base. The enemy requires a clear view of the "wealth" in order to be enticed and funneled through the opening with the generator.
          To position pawns on the generator the player need to create zones on the generator then undraft the pawns. There should be two pawns snugly positioned in the same zone on the left side of the generator: one responsible for attacking enemies from behind, and the other for repairing the exposed generator. The zone on top of the generator is for smart animals that can help you absorb damage and deal out damage, although it is not mandatory. The drafted pawn on the right side of the generator should be heavily armored since they will bear the brunt of enemy attacks if they manage to get past the generator. Like any killbox, this setup requires enemy collision to be triggered when they enter.

            You need to set up zones to position your undrafted pawns on the generator. There should be two pawns snugly positioned in the same zone on the left side of the generator: one responsible for attacking enemies from behind, and the other for repairing the exposed generator. The zone on top of the generator is for smart animals that can help you absorb damage and deal out damage, although it is not mandatory.

            The issue with the original sap box lies in its kill efficiency. If you're playing on harder difficulties, your pawns will spend an extremely long time dealing with a single raid since you're heavily reliant on animals and melee. This is where the singularity point comes into play. Introducing the 69 killbox (or the 9 killbox), a combination of sap and singularity kb, named after its unique shape.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="images/sap3.png" class="img-fluid rounded thumb" alt="Image description">
            <p class="caption my-3"></p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The 9 killbox takes advantage of the singularity point property by incorporating doors to enable peeking, thereby introducing five additional pawns into the equation. Due to the singularity point, these five pawns will not be targeted by enemy pawns or mechanoids unless there are unintended items of wealth (such as furniture or torches) in the room they occupy. If such items are present, they may draw enemy aggression and allow the enemies to gain vision on the five pawns. It is an exceptionally efficient and powerful killbox that remains effective even in late game.

        <p>By making some changes, we can now have four people aiming at one singularity point in the entrance. Now, the enemies walking in will either die instantly due to sheer firepower or perish aimlessly on their way up while attempting to find cover. This straightforward setup can be further improved by adding EMP devices, creating additional shooting positions at the top, and including shooting positions at the bottom.

        <p class="caption my-3 text-center">Modified singularity killbox by Brotha Onion</p>
        <p> Killboxes like these rely heavily on enemy pawns being unable to see player pawns when they enter. The singularity point ensures that enemies won't take cover or shoot back in the corridor leading up to the killbox. By the time the enemies gain vision, they are already exposed in the open, and due to the peculiar programming, they have to find cover before they can retaliate. Players can fully exploit this enemy behavior by placing melee pawns or pets at the cover location, converting it into a fire room, or employing both strategies. It's important to note that mechanoids will not seek cover and can sometimes disrupt the collision system. In such cases, EMP devices, high DPS (damage per second), and animal meat shields become necessary.
